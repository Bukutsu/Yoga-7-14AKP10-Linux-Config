Shared hardware optimizations live here so both the Arch and Fedora guides can stay focused on distro-specific work. The steps below are distro-agnostic and apply whenever the Lenovo Yoga 7 14AKP10 (14AKP10 / 83JR) hardware is in use.

## NPU (Neural Processing Unit) Status
The Ryzen AI (AMD XDNA 2) NPU is the newest component in this stack. The official `amdxdna` Linux kernel driver was introduced in Linux 6.14 and sees expanded features (like power reporting and better upstreaming) in the upcoming Linux 7.0/7.1 kernels. 
- **FastFlowLM:** The most mature current option for Linux is **FastFlowLM**, a custom lightweight runtime designed specifically for tile-structured NPUs, which allows for highly efficient local LLM inference directly on the NPU.
- **Ollama:** Official, native XDNA NPU support inside Ollama is actively being tracked and developed (e.g., via upstream integrations with RyzenAI-SW), but you may need to use FastFlowLM or specific forks if you want out-of-the-box NPU offloading today.

## System Performance
- **ZRAM:** Arch (CachyOS) ships with zram enabled; on other distros install `zram-generator` if `zramctl` shows no devices.

## Audio & EasyEffects
- **Presets:** The repository stores `configs/audio/easyeffects_presets/*.json` and is linked from both guides. Import the desired JSON in EasyEffects.  
- **RNNoise chain:** Use the `RNNoise` plugin on the mic input for real-time noise reduction.  
- **EQ:** `lsp-plugins-lv2` and `calf` provide the required filters.

## Wi-Fi Power Save (MT7925e)
- Use the canonical config `configs/system/network/disable-wifi-powersave.conf` and copy it to `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/`.  
  ```bash
  sudo cp configs/system/network/disable-wifi-powersave.conf /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/
  sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
  ```
  **Verify:** `nmcli general logging level` or check `journalctl -u NetworkManager` for `wifi.powersave = 2`.

## Troubleshooting
- **scx_loader/scx.service fails to start:** Run `journalctl -u scx_loader.service -u scx.service`. Confirm `scx-scheds`, `scx-manager`, and `cachyos-settings` are installed and match the kernel version.  
- **Wi-Fi still flickers:** `nmcli general logging level 3` plus `journalctl -u NetworkManager` will show if `wifi.powersave` reverted. Reapply `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/disable-wifi-powersave.conf` and restart the service.  
- **EasyEffects presets won't load:** Verify the JSON resides in `configs/audio/easyeffects_presets/`. Install `lsp-plugins-lv2`, `calf`, and `rnnoise` packages, then restart EasyEffects.

## Verification Checklist
| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| EasyEffects presets | Open EasyEffects, import JSON from `configs/audio/easyeffects_presets/` |
| Wi-Fi power save | `journalctl -u NetworkManager \| grep powersave` |
